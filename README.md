## NodeJS and Typescript - Get exchanges orders book

Majority of trading platforms are connected to major exchanges around the world. The price offered at any certain point differs from exchange to exchange. The traders are not directly connected to exchanges rather via trading platforms.

Trading platforms can leverage from various price options available to them via exchanges orders book, during a certain trading activity and calculate price index delivered to their users.

### What we could do?

Let's assume we are trading platform owner. To calculate price index, we need a way to collect orders book from exchanges, perform required calculations and make it available to users.

> [!Note]
> The request for getting orders book from exchanges can be originated either by platform user or platform internal component or system.

### Technical flow we could implement

We would discuss technical flow and api design in two folds. First step is our own API gateway or REST endpoint and Second step is request being originated from our backend server to exchanges. We need to expose a REST endpoint. Whenever the endpoint is hit, it goes and fetches orders book from various exchanges, prunes the incoming data, calculate price index and finally return the price index.

Orders book from exchanges can be received via REST API and web sockets endpoints. Below is step by step flow;

1. User hits REST endpoint
2. Once endpoint hit, server initiates parallel REST and Web Sockets calls to exchanges endpoints.
3. Once all the request to exchanges are finalized, the server calculates price index.
4. Finally the endpoint returns price index to user or request originator.

### Tech Stack

We can go with developing the endpoint in `Node JS` and `Typescript` using [Nest JS](https://nestjs.com/). Also, We can use `Jest` for writing tests. Moreover, we have used `Axios` for `REST API` calls and `ws` for `web sockets` communications.

### Implementation details

Le'ts take major exchanges such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and [Huobi](https://www.htx.com/) (now called HTX). Below are list of endpoints and their respective response for above mentioned exchanges;

1. Binance (https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/rest-api#order-book)
2. Kraken (https://docs.kraken.com/api/docs/rest-api/get-order-book)
3. Huobi (HTX) (https://www.htx.com/en-us/opend/newApiPages/?id=7ec5342e-7773-11ed-9966-0242ac110003)

The project exposes one `GET` endpoint `/prices/price-index`. The server fetch resources from Binance and Kraken hitting their REST endpoint using axios. The server uses web sockets in order to fetch resources from Huobi. 

**Let's see what aspects have been covered**

1. All promises are resolved. Moreover, for websockets we make sure to close the socket once we are done with our desired task.
2. It is natural that response data and its depth varies from exchange to exchange. It is suggested to  take the approach to generalize it with pattern mapper. So, we shall not worry about future addition of new exchanges. ðŸ™‚ Well of course we need to provide the `dataPath` for any new exchange.
3. Before going for `globalPriceIndex` calculation, we make sure required data for calculation is in correct format and data. This would help avoid unforeseen errors for future new exchanges addition.
4. we are generous enough ðŸ˜‰ and always return `200 status` to user/requester.

> [!Note]
> The idea behind always sending `200 status` to user/requester lies in the functions distributability for the future. We need not to go back to user/requester with Error if any of the exchanges got in trouble, rather we need to track bad responses and treat them to fix.


### Get started with project

If you have reached here reading all along, i am sure you are interested to give it a shot. So, You can clone the project and install dependencies;

```bash
npm i
```

here are commands you can make use of;

```bash
# start server in dev environment
npm run start:dev

# start server in production  environment (post deployment)
npm run start:prod

# Run tests and e2e tets
npm run test & npm run test:e2e

# Build project
npm run build

```

### Well Done ðŸš€
I hope you have enjoyed going through the code base and this document was helpful. If you want to improve the code or have something in mind about taking it off to production, it does make sense. I am looking forward to your contribution.
